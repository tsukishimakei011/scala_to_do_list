This application, named Meow To Do List, focuses on recording the user's tasks and 
organizing them efficiently.

<h1 align="left">Description</h1>
<p> This application allows users to add, edit, delete tasks as well as update their
current task status in the application in order to help them manage their daily activities 
effectively. Moreover, the user can interact with the application by playing a mini game
included within it. Whenever the user completes a task, they are awarded 10 points. These 
points can be used to interact with the virtual "cat" in the mini game. After the user has 
interacted with the virtual "cat" a certain number of times, a special animation will be 
triggered. Thus, this application not only records the userâ€™s daily tasks but also boosts 
productivity by rewarding task completion. By incorporating a fun and engaging mini game, 
the application motivates users to stay on top of their tasks as well as the reward system, 
where points earned through task completion can be used to interact with a virtual "cat," adds 
an element of gamification, making the process of task management both enjoyable and 
productive.</p>
